This program prints :
	"Flop" if a number is divisible by 5
	"Flip" if a number is divisible by 3 and
	"Flip Flop" if divisible by BOTH 3 and 5
	Nothing if divisibe by NEITHER

	Your number was 351532211631

	Flip 

	Debugging couts in printResults function: 
	The int value of the last digit in "number"
		(here call the corresponding function) is 1.
	The sum of digits in "number" 
		(here call the corresponding function) is 33.
