This program prints :
	"Flop" if a number is divisible by 5
	"Flip" if a number is divisible by 3 and
	"Flip Flop" if divisible by BOTH 3 and 5
	Nothing if divisibe by NEITHER

	Your number was 5
	Flop 
	Debugging couts in printResults function: 
	The int value of the last digit in "number"
		(here call the corresponding function) is 5.
	The sum of digits in "number" 
		(here call the corresponding function) is 5.

	*****************************************

	Your number was 990
	Flip Flop 
	Debugging couts in printResults function: 
	The int value of the last digit in "number"
		(here call the corresponding function) is 0.
	The sum of digits in "number" 
		(here call the corresponding function) is 18.

	*****************************************

	Your number was 9
	Flip 
	Debugging couts in printResults function: 
	The int value of the last digit in "number"
		(here call the corresponding function) is 9.
	The sum of digits in "number" 
		(here call the corresponding function) is 9.
